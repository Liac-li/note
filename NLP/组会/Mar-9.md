## 程瞰之

- CLIPSore: A reference-free evaluation metric for image captioning
    - 对于同样的内容描述，但是出现了没有出现过的词语
    - 或者是没有 reference 的现实场景

- QE: For image caption based on large-scale
    - proof a human supervised data-set is useful

??? QE & reference-free metric (in MT is same)

In MT, QE is used in task without reference data set, because that MT always show that score with reference are better

- Bidimensional leaderboards: Generate and Evaluate language hand in hand

#### Summary

1. use QE(reference free) scores in image caption
2. novel object in image caption, or how to make use of real world conception or huge data in large-scale pre-trained model

## 王洪科

1. add data set
2. few-shot learning
