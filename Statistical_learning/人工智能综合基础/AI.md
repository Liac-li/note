#### Part 1

- Agent
    - Reflex agent: 
        - act base on sensors, 
        - no memory, no env-model
    - Reflex agent with state: 
        - store history of observed env
        - rule driven
    - goal-based agent
        -  no manual rules
    - utility-based agent
    - learning agent
        - learning element + performance element + problem generation

- Uninformed Search Algorithm
    - DFS; BFS
        - Tree search & graph search (with `closed_set` for circle in graph)
    - limited depth DFS
    
- informed search
    - A* optimization
    - Graph search
    
- Multi-agent search
    - alpha-beta pruning
    - search order is important
    - heuristic function: how to decision
    - search with random node

- Bandits & MCTS
    - epsilon-greedy; upper-confidence bound;
    
- General space search

- constraint satisfaction search

#### Knowledge

- 

- Bayesian
- approx mc inference

#### Learning

- PAC
