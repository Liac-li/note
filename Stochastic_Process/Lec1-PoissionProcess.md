#### Poisson Distribution

X is said to have a Poisson distribution with **parameter $\lambda, \lambda > 0$**, if :
$$
    P(X = k) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!} \\
    \mathbb{E}[X] = \lambda\\
    Var[X] = \lambda
$$

Poisson distribution with $\lambda = np$ can be used as an approximation if $n$ is sufficiently large and $p$ is sufficiently small

**Brun's sieve**:
    if $$E\left[\left(\frac{X}{j}\right)\right] \approx \lambda^i / i!$$
