# Local Search and Evolutionary Alg

#### Local Search

- Hill-climbing
- Simulated annealing
- Local beam search
- Local search for continuous spaces

#### Evolutionary Algorithm

search on whole set

Random algorithm

###### 8-queens problem

- Init: randomly generated solutions, and evolution
- Steps: use **soft max** as the probability of the fitness of every population

Advantages:
- Parallelism
- Only **Goodness** functions needed

**Stop**:
1. Target fitness
2. mun of unchanged loop 
3. min level accepted
